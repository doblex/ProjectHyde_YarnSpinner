📖 Project Setup & Structure
🛠 Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

Visual Studio Code
Download and install VS Code from the official website.

Yarn Spinner Extension
In VS Code, install the plugin called “Yarn Spinner”.
This allows you to safely open and edit .yarn files.

📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

PlainText/

Contains all text references.

Used as the source for dialogue and written content.

YarnFiles/

Contains all .yarn files.

This is where Yarn Spinner scripts should be created and edited.

⚠️ Important Note

For better organization and consistency:

Each file in PlainText/ should share the same name as its corresponding file in YarnFiles/.

Example:

PlainText/intro.txt
YarnFiles/intro.yarn
